<h1 style='text-align: center'>Privacy policy for the Alexa/Zenkit sync skill</h1>

This privacy policy describes how the Alexa/Zenkit  (“us” or “we”) protects your (“you”, “the user”) privacy and your data.
Before using the Alexa Zenkit sync Skill, please read this policy as well as the following Alexa and Zenkit privacy policies:
https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740
https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468496
https://zenkit.com/en/privacy/

<br>Regarding Amazon, “Alexa” means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like our skills) and other related Software.

If you use one of our skills you fully agree to this privacy policy.

<h1 style='text-align: center'>General</h1>

When you use our skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and us where we use it to understand what our skill should do for you. This is absolutely necessary for our service to give you an appropriate answer.

<h1 style='text-align: center'>Data</h1>

We never collect or share personal data with our skills. To improve our services we may need to manually review data collected, but will only do so with your explicit permission.

Data is only connected to your Alexa-UserId but never to your name or any other personal information. In the case of our “sittmacher” skill we save how many milliliters you drank per day. Otherwise we could not provide you this service.

<h1 style='text-align: center'>Changes</h1>

Our skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy might change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of our skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.

<h1 style='text-align: center'>Data Storage:</h1>
This skill stores current list items in temporary storage for the purposes of syncing between skills. Items that are deleted from Zenkit or Alexa are synced (deleted from the other account) and then deleted from the data store. The entire datastore is deleted when the customer diables the skill. All data is hosted in AWS and is not exported.

<h1 style='text-align: center'>Data use:</h1>
The data collected is only used for the direct functionatliy of the skill. Manual access is only for the purposes of debugging.
