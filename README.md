## Disclaimer

**The is an unofficial skill meaning it should only be used for personal usage. I do not have any affiliations with Zenkit or Amazon.**

## Introduction

This skill provides Alexa shopping list synchronization with a todo.zenkit.com shopping list with the same name. It will create a zenkit shopping list if one doesn't exist. Right now, this only supports syncing the shopping list, but hoping to expand soon.
